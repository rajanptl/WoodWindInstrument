# Description of the machine
The system consists of a BrickPi, a battery pack, a small speaker, a EV3 Touch sensor, an EV3 Ultrasonic Sensor, Lego pieces and a few other parts distributed by the University. The structure was made by keeping in mind that the BrickPi and the battery pack should not fall out of the instrument as this might damage the hardware. The Touch Sensor and the Ultrasonic Sensor were connected to ports 1 and 2 of the BrickPi respectively. To ensure that the sensors do not disconnect from the BrickPi or dangle around, they were both fixed onto the structure of the instrument using the materials provided by the University. Finally, the small speaker was connected onto the audio jack of the BrickPi and just like the sensors, it was also fixed onto the structure of the instrument. A representation of the entire instrument excluding the speaker can be seen in Figure 1.
